    <h1>Large Language Models for Patents</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Patents, a form of intellectual property (IP), grant the inventor temporary rights to suppress competing use of an invention in exchange for a disclosure of the invention. It was once established to promote and/or control technical innovation and progress. The surge in global patent applications and the rapid technological progress pose formidable challenges to patent offices and related practitioners. For example, novelty is one of the essential requirements for patents, which takes a vast amount of resources and time for human assessment. Reviewing patents can take years because it is complex and detail-oriented. Even experienced examiners can overlook critical information or fail in judgment. In addition, drafting patent applications necessitates the expertise of qualified patent agents or attorneys. It requires a profound understanding of the invention's technical details and a familiarity with pertinent patent laws and language conventions. Meticulous and precise patent texts are essential for securing robust patent protection. However, drafting and revising patent applications are both time-intensive and financially demanding. Each round of revising can generate costs of up to thousands of dollars, presenting considerable challenges, particularly for small enterprises. These challenges overwhelm traditional manual methods of patent analysis and drafting. Consequently, there is a significant need for advanced computational techniques to automate patent-related tasks. Such automation not only enhances the efficiency of patent and IP management but also facilitates the development of technological innovation. </p>

    <p>Researchers have investigated machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods for the patent field with highly technical and legal texts. In addition, the recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities across a wide range of general domain text-based tasks. These models are promising to become valuable tools in managing and drafting patent literature, the crucial documentation resource of technological advances. However, compared to the significant success of LLMs in the general domain, the application of LLMs in patent-related tasks remains under-explored due to their complexity. Therefore, we aim to apply cutting-edge LLMs to this specialized domain and exploit a so far underutilized highly-formalized technological knowledge source to boost and even automate innovation. </p>
