I am a PhD student in the Department of Engineering at University of Cambridge, Churchill College, supervised by Dr.Stephan Goetz. My research is about the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the patent domain, including patent analysis and patent text generation. If you are interested in related topics, please feel free to contact me. Prior to this, I obtained my master degree in Advanced Computer Science at University of Cambridge and bachelor degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Nottingham.
