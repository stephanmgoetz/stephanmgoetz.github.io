I am previously a joint PhD in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on exploring integrated topologies, high-temperature module packaging, and the control strategy of resonant converters.
Driven by a passion for innovation, I am committed to continuously enhancing my skills and knowledge. My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to the field of power electronics and make a positive impact within the industry.
I warmly invite you to engage in discussions and collaborations via mq234@cam.ac.uk if you share an interest in my research endeavors. Let's connect and explore new possibilities together!
