I am a lecturer in Electrical Engineering Division at University of Cambridge. My research interests include modular power electronics in general, precise high-power pulse synthesizers for magnetic neurostimulation, and integrative power electronics solutions for microgrids and electric vehicle applications. I received the Undergraduate and Graduate degrees from TU Muenchen, Munich, Germany, and the Ph.D. degree with a thesis on medical applications of power electronics from TU Muenchen and from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2012, respectively. 

If you are interted in doing a PhD with me, please feel free to contact me!
