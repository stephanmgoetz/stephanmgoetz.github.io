I am a PhD student supervised by Dr. Stephan Goetz in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. My research interests include computational neuroscience, modelling of transcranial magnetic stimulation, statistical models, biomedical engineering, control systems, and optimisation. I received a BEng degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from the University of Liverpool with the first class (Top One), and an MSc degree in Electrical Engineering Department from Imperial College London with distinction. I am currently studying and analysing neuromodulation variability involved in transcranial magnetic stimulation using mathematical techniques. Moreover, I am developing a new software for analysing the variability of motor-evoked potential as well.
