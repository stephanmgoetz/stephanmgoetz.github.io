I am a PhD student supervised by Dr. Stefan Goetz in the Department of Engineering at University of Cambridge. My research interests include power flow/quality control, grid-forming converters, and applications of WBG devices. You can find my publication [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gNH_3UMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received the BEng degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, the BEng (first class) degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Leeds, Leeds, UK, both in 2021, and the MPhil degree in Engineering from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, in 2022.
